        MIRING stands for <u>M</u>inimum <u>I</u>nformation for <u>R</u>eport<u>i</u>ng <u>N</u>ext Generation Sequencing <u>G</u>enotyping.  It is a checklist of elements that should be included when transmitting NGS Genotyping data.  
      </p>
      <p align="center">
        The purpose of MIRING is to enable downstream platform-independant analysis and re-analaysis of genotyping data, and allow comparison between the genotyping results of different platforms, references, or methodologies.
      </p>
      <p align="center">
        MIRING is intended to be a restriction on the syntax or format of the data, but more as a set of minimum requirements for what should be present.  This MIRING validator specifically is intented to be used on an XML document compliant with <a href="http://schemas.nmdp.org/spec/hml/1.0.1/hml-1.0.1.xsd">HML 1.0.1.</a>
